This is a video showing how to create a record in Nexudus. The audio of the video holds important details about this process. Use the audio in the video to enhance the details of this guide.

Produce detailed and complete step by step user instructions to be used as documentation for the Nexudus platform and based on the actions taken in the video and the audio prompts in it. Make sure to include details based on the audio prompts in each step as needed.


Group the sequence of actions into related groups of actions and use a single <Steps> component to communicate this to the user. Each <Step> should have a numbered list of sub-steps within.

Example:

<Steps>
 <Step title="actions group 1">
  - action 1
  - action 2
  </Step>
 <Step title="actions group 2">
  - action 3
  - action 4
  </Step>
...
</Steps>
