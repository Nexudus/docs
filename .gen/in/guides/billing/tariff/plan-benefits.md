- This video describes how to create a plan that includes an amount of meeting room credit.

Explain these concepts in the introduction:

- Plans can have any combination of passes, money credit and time credit.
- Passes can be used to check customers in and control access to your IT network. When a customer is checked in, the pass is used.
- Money credit can be set to be valid to pay for bookings, events, products or any other purchases, even plans.
- Unlike benefits added to products, benefits added to plans must always expire.
- You can make credit expires based on the billing cycle of the plan, every day, week or calendar month
- Removing credit from an existing plan will not remove credits given to members in the plan.
- Adding credit to an existing plan will immediately add this credit to members in that plan.
