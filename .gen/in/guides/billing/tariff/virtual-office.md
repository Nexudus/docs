- A virtual office plan is like a regular plan when it comes to billing but offers additional options to on-board customers (like what identity and address check they should do) and how to handle deliveries
- Identity and address checks can be done either manually or using Stripe Identity if supported in your country.
- Each virtual office plan can be set to offer handling of different delivery types: Mail, Parcels, Checks and Publicity.
- Each delivery type can then be associated with different handling options: Store for collection, Forward, Open, scan & forward, Open, scan & recycle, Open, scan & shred, Open, scan & store for collection, Recycle, Return to sender, Shred
- Each handling option can have different charges (based on products) associated to them
