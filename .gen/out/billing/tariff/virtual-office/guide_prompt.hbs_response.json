{"description":"Create and configure virtual office plans in Nexudus to manage customer onboarding and delivery handling.","introduction_markdown":"A **virtual office plan** in Nexudus is similar to a regular plan in terms of billing but provides additional options for onboarding customers and managing deliveries. This feature is particularly useful for coworking spaces and flexible workspaces that offer virtual office services, allowing them to streamline the process of setting up and managing virtual office memberships.\n\nWith virtual office plans, you can configure **identity and address checks**, specify delivery handling options, and define limits for company aliases and forwarding addresses. This ensures that you can tailor the virtual office experience to meet the specific needs of your customers while maintaining control over your resources.\n\nKey aspects of virtual office plans include:\n\n*   **Customer Onboarding**: Set requirements for identity and address verification, choosing between manual checks or using Stripe Identity (if supported in your country).\n*   **Delivery Handling**: Configure handling options for various delivery types such as Mail, Parcels, Checks, and Publicity. Each delivery type can be associated with different handling options like Store for collection, Forward, Open, scan & forward, and more.\n*   **Charge Association**: Link different charges (based on products) to each handling option, allowing you to bill customers for specific delivery services.\n*   **Alias and Address Limits**: Define the number of company aliases, additional recipients, and forwarding addresses per recipient that customers can add to their virtual office plan.","steps":[{"step_title":"Create Product","sub_steps":[{"step_description_markdown":"Navigate to **Inventory**
