  "introduction_markdown": "Plans in Nexudus are a cornerstone for managing your customer subscriptions, coworking memberships, and private office inventories. They offer a flexible way to bundle benefits such as booking or printing credits, which are then assigned to customers upon signup. Plans can have any combination of passes, money credit and time credit, allowing you to tailor your offerings to meet diverse customer needs.\n\n**Passes for Access Control**\nPasses are instrumental in managing access to your space. They enable customers to check in and out, thereby controlling access to your IT network and physical locations. Each check-in consumes a pass, making them a practical tool for managing access frequency and duration.\n\n**Money Credit for Purchases**\nMoney credit offers your customers the flexibility to pay for a wide range of services and products within your space. This includes bookings, events, products, and even other plans. This versatility makes money credit a valuable addition to any plan, enhancing customer satisfaction and encouraging further engagement with your offerings.\n\n**Credit Expiration and Management**\nUnlike benefits added directly to products, credits added to plans are designed to expire, ensuring regular engagement and preventing long-term accumulation of unused benefits. You have the flexibility to set credit expiration based on the plan's billing cycle, or on a daily, weekly, or monthly basis, aligning with your business model and customer usage patterns.\n\n**Important Considerations for Credit Management**\nIt's important to note that removing credit from an existing plan does not retroactively remove credits already given to members under that plan. Conversely, adding credit to an existing plan immediately grants this credit to all current members of the plan, ensuring immediate benefit and satisfaction.\n",
