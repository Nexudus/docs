title: Create Prorated Plan
description: Create prorated plans with prices adjusted based on customer sign-up and cancellation dates.
---

This guide explains how to create a prorated plan in Nexudus, allowing you to adjust the price based on when a customer signs up or cancels their plan within a month. This feature is particularly useful for coworking spaces and flexible workspaces as it ensures fair billing for members who don't start or end their contracts on the first day of the month.

Prorating discounts both the initial and last invoices of a contract based on the number of days between the sign-up/cancellation dates and the billing day of the contract. It's important to note that **benefits are not prorated**.

The setting **Discount the first invoice for up to X days based on how many days are left in the first billing cycle** controls the maximum number of days between the start day and the next billing day for prorating to apply. For example, if you have a plan priced at $100 per month and set this option to 31 days, a customer signing up on the 15th of the month will receive a prorated discount on their first invoice.

The **Discount the last invoice based on the day members leave contracts for this plan** option adjusts the last invoice based on the number of days between the billing day and the contract's end date. Prorating accounts for the actual number of days in each month, ensuring accurate billing regardless of the month's length.
