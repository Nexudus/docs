title: Prorated Plan Creation
description: Create a prorated plan with a price that is adjusted based on sign-up and cancellation dates.
---

In Nexudus, **prorating** allows you to adjust the price of a plan based on when a customer signs up or cancels within a month. This is particularly useful for coworking spaces as it ensures fair billing for members who join or leave mid-cycle. By prorating, you discount the initial and last invoices of a contract based on the number of days between the sign-up/cancellation dates and the billing day of the contract. Note that benefits are not prorated.

*   The setting **Discount the first invoice for up to X days based on how many days are left in the first billing cycle** controls the maximum number of days between the start day and the next billing day for prorating to apply. For example, if you have a plan that costs $100 per month and a customer signs up 15 days before the next billing cycle, they will only be charged $50 for the first month.
*   The **Discount the last invoice based on the day members leave contracts for this plan** option adjusts the last invoice based on the number of days between the billing day and the cancellation date. Prorating accounts for the actual number of days in each month.
