{"description":"Create a prorated plan with a price that is adjusted based on sign-up and cancellation dates.","introduction_markdown":"In Nexudus, **prorating** allows you to adjust the price of a plan based on when a customer signs up or cancels within a month. This is particularly useful for coworking spaces as it ensures fair billing for members who join or leave mid-cycle. By prorating, you discount the initial and last invoices of a contract based on the number of days between the sign-up/cancellation dates and the billing day of the contract. Note that benefits are not prorated.\n\n*   The setting **Discount the first invoice for up to X days based on how many days are left in the first billing cycle** controls the maximum number of days between the start day and the next billing day for prorating to apply. For example, if you have a plan that costs $100 per month and a customer signs up 15 days before the next billing cycle, they will only be charged $50 for the first month.\n*   The **Discount the last invoice based on the day members leave contracts for this plan** option adjusts the last invoice based on the number of days between the billing day and the cancellation date. Prorating accounts for the actual number of days in each month.","steps":[{"step_duration":6.96,"step_start_time":"0:03","step_title":"Navigate to Plans","sub_steps":[{"step_description_markdown":"From the dashboard, navigate to **Inventory** on the left side menu.","sub_step_duration":2.13,"sub_step_start_time":"0:03"},{"step_description_markdown":"On the Inventory page, click on the **Plans** option.","sub_step_duration":2.03,"sub_step_start_time":"0:05"},{"step_description_markdown":"Click the **Add plan** button on the top right of the screen.","sub_step_duration":2.8,"sub_step_start_time":"0:07"}]},{"step_duration":12.84,"step_start_time":"0:10","step_title":"Create a Manual Entry Plan","sub_steps":[{"step_description_markdown":"In the Add plan dialog, select **Manual entry** to create a new plan from scratch.","sub_step_duration":1.74,"sub_step_start_time":"0:13"},{"step_description_markdown":"In the Plan name field, enter the name of the plan.
