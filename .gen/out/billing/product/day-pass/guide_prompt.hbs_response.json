  "introduction_markdown": "This document guides you through the process of creating a **Day Pass product** in Nexudus. A Day Pass product includes one or more passes as part of its benefits. This feature solves the problem of managing temporary access to your coworking space and network for non-members. By following these steps, you can easily set up a Day Pass product that allows customers to check in, use the space, and access your network for a specified period. This makes it easier for you to offer flexible access options and manage your resources effectively.\n\nWith Nexudus, a pass can be used to check customers in. When a customer is checked in, the pass is used. Passes can be set to be valid by calendar day or for a number of hours across days. You can connect a pass to your network controller to grant access to the network to those purchasing the day pass product. If the buyer is a contact (i.e they are not a member - they don't have an active contract). The passes added to the product are only released when the product is paid. You can make passes expire a set amount of time after the purchase.",
