### Products

In the context of the Nexudus Platform, **products** are items or services that can be sold through the platform. These include anything a space operator might offer to customers, such as:

- Physical goods (e.g., snacks, drinks, merchandise)
- One-off services (e.g., meeting room bookings, printing credits)
- Add-ons or extras (e.g., locker rental, mailbox services)

Products can be sold via different sales channels across the platform, such as the **Admin Panel**, **Member's Portal**, **NexIO**, **Passport by Nexudus**, and integrated **Point of Sale (POS)** systems. Each product can have customizable settings, including pricing, taxes, availability, inventory tracking, and visibility to specific customer types or plans.
