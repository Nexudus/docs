### What is a Product?

In the Nexudus Platform, **Products** refer to items or services that can be sold to members or visitors. These include tangible items like coffee or drinks, as well as intangible services such as day passes, bundles of day passes, and benefit bundles like printing credit or time credit. Products can also encompass additional services related to meeting rooms, enhancing the overall experience for users.

### When to use Products?

Use **Products** when you want to offer items or services that are not tied to specific bookings or memberships. Avoid using Products for items like meeting rooms, event tickets, or memberships, as these are managed differently within the platform.

### Some examples

- Day passes or bundles of day passes
- Coffee and other drinks
- Benefit bundles: printing credit, money or time credit
- Meeting rooms additional services
- Other services
