---

A day pass product includes one or more passes as part of its benefits. A pass can be used to check customers in. When a customer is checked in, the pass is used. Passes can be set to be valid by calendar day or for a number of hours across days. You can connect a pass to your network controller to grant access to the network to those purchasing the day pass product. If the buyer is a contact (i.e they are not a member - they don't have an active contract). The passes added to the product are only released when the product is paid. You can make passes expire a set amount of time after the purchase.

This feature solves the problem of managing temporary access to your coworking space. It simplifies the process of selling day passes and ensuring that customers can easily check in and access the resources they need. By connecting passes to your network controller, you can also automate network access for day pass holders, making their experience seamless and convenient.
