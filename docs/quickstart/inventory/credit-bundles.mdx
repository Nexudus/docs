description: Learn how to create a new resource type and a product with benefits in Nexudus.

Products can have any combination of **passes**, **money credit** and **time credit**. **Passes** can be used to check customers in and control access to your IT network. When a customer is checked in, the pass is used. **Money credit** can be set to be valid to pay for bookings, events, products or any other purchases, even plans. If the buyer is a contact (i.e they are not a member - they don't have an active contract). The benefits added to the product are only released when the product is paid. You can make any of the benefits expire after an amount of time. Changes made to benefits of existing products only take affect when the products are purchased again. This feature is relevant to a coworking space because it allows you to offer a variety of products and services to your members and guests.
