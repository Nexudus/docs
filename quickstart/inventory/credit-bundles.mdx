### Understanding product benefits

A product bundling credit is a fantastic way to offer your customers a package deal, combining different types of credits to enhance their experience at your space. Think of it as creating a custom bundle of perks that they can enjoy!


### Types Of Credits 

Here's a breakdown of the different credit types you can include in a product:

*   **Passes:** These are like virtual keys to your space! You can add passes to your product to grant access to your space. Each time a customer uses your space, the pass will be used. You can also use passes to allow customers to connect to your IT network!
*   **Money Credit:** This acts like a gift card, giving your customers a specific monetary value to spend within your space. You decide what this credit can be used for. It can be applied to bookings, events, product purchases, or even towards their membership plan fees.
*   **Time Credit:** This credit gives customers an amount of time of free meeting room usage. 

**Expiration Dates:** You can set expiration dates for any of the benefits included in the product bundle.

<Warning>
  If someone purchases the product bundle but isn't a member (meaning they don't have a contract with you), the passes and credits included in the bundle will only become available to them once they've paid for the product.
</Warning>
<Warning>
  If you make changes to a product bundle (add more credit, change the expiration date, etc.), these changes will only apply to *new* purchases of that product. Customers who purchased the bundle *before* the changes were made will not be affected.
</Warning>
