title: Products with credit
description: Learn how to add a resource type and a product to your Nexudus account. This product can be configured with money credit to be used for bookings, events, products or any other purchases, even plans.
---

In Nexudus, **products can have any combination of passes, money credit, and time credit**. Passes can be used to check customers in and control access to your IT network. When a customer is checked in, the pass is used. Money credit can be set to be valid to pay for bookings, events, products, or any other purchases, even plans. If the buyer is a contact (i.e., they are not a member; they don't have an active contract), the benefits added to the product are only released when the product is paid.

This guide will show you how to set up a new product with money credit to be used in your space.
