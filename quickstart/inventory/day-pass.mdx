### Understanding Day Pass Products

Think of a **Day Pass Product** as a flexible way to offer access to your space for a limited time. It's perfect for attracting new customers, accommodating occasional users, or offering trials.

Here's the core idea:

*   **It's a Package of Passes:** When you create a Day Pass Product, you're essentially bundling one or more "passes" together.

*   **Passes = Entry & Usage:** Each pass included in the product allows a customer to check in to your space. When they check in, one of their passes is used up. So, if you sell a Day Pass Product with 5 passes, the customer can visit your space 5 times.

*   **Flexible Validity:** You decide how long each pass is valid:

    *   **Calendar Day:** Valid for a single calendar day (e.g., they can come anytime on a specific day).
    *   **Number of Hours:** Valid for a certain number of hours (e.g., a 4-hour pass that can be used across multiple days).

*   **Network Access (Optional):** Want to give day pass holders Wi-Fi access?  You can connect a pass to your network controller. When a customer uses a pass to check in, they'll automatically be granted network access for the duration of their pass. This simplifies the process and keeps your network secure.

*   **Payment First (For Non-Members):** If someone buying a Day Pass Product *isn't* already a member with an active contract (we call them "Contacts" in Nexudus), the passes are only released to them once they've paid for the product. This ensures you get paid before they start using your space.

*   **Expiry Dates:** You can set an expiry date for the passes from when they are purchased.

In short, Day Pass Products give you a powerful and flexible way to:

*   Monetize occasional use of your space.
*   Attract new customers.
*   Streamline the access process.
