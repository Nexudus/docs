### Understanding plan benefits

Plans in Nexudus can include a variety of benefits to make them more attractive to your customers. You can bundle passes, money credit, and time credit into your plans.

### Types of Credits

Here's a breakdown of the different credit types you can include in a plan:

*   **Passes**: These can be used to check customers in and control access to your IT network. Each time a customer checks in, a pass is used.
*   **Money Credit**: Customers can use this credit to pay for bookings, events, products, or even other plans.
*   **Time Credit**: This credit gives your customers a specific amount of time to use your resources, such as meeting rooms or equipment.

### Key Details About Credits in Plans

*   **Expiration**: Unlike benefits added to products, all benefits added to plans must expire.
*   **Expiration Cycle**: You can set credits to expire based on the billing cycle of the plan, or on a daily, weekly, or monthly basis.

<Warning>
    Removing credit from an existing plan will not remove credits already given to members in the plan.
</Warning>
<Warning>
    Adding credit to an existing plan will immediately add this credit to members in that plan.
</Warning>

By strategically bundling these credits, you can create compelling plans that meet the diverse needs of your customer base.
