This guide describes how to create a plan that includes an amount of meeting room credit. Plans can have any combination of **passes**, **money credit** and **time credit**. Passes can be used to check customers in and control access to your IT network. When a customer is checked in, the pass is used. Money credit can be set to be valid to pay for bookings, events, products or any other purchases, even plans. 

Unlike benefits added to products, benefits added to plans must always expire. You can make credit expires based on the billing cycle of the plan, every day, week or calendar month. Removing credit from an existing plan will not remove credits given to members in the plan. Adding credit to an existing plan will immediately add this credit to members in that plan.
