Virtual Office Plans are a great way to offer your customers a professional business presence without the need for a physical office space. Think of them as regular plans, but with extra features designed specifically for virtual office services. These plans not only handle billing like any other plan but also give you more control over how you onboard customers and manage their deliveries.

### Onboarding and Verification

With Virtual Office Plans, you can customize the onboarding process by specifying which identity and address checks are required for new customers. You have the flexibility to perform these checks manually or, if supported in your country, you can use Stripe Identity for a streamlined process. This ensures you're always compliant and know who your customers are.

### Delivery Management

One of the key features of Virtual Office Plans is the ability to manage different types of deliveries, including:

-   Mail
-   Parcels
-   Checks
-   Publicity

For each of these delivery types, you can define specific handling options, such as:

-   **Store for collection**: Keep the delivery safe until the customer picks it up.
-   **Forward**: Send the delivery to the customer's specified address.
-   **Open, scan & forward**: Open the delivery, scan the contents, and forward it to the customer.
-   **Open, scan & recycle**: Open the delivery, scan the contents, and recycle it.
-   **Open, scan & shred**: Open the delivery, scan the contents, and shred it.
-   **Open, scan & store for collection**: Open the delivery, scan the contents, and store it for customer pickup.
-   **Recycle**: Recycle the delivery.
-   **Return to sender**: Send the delivery back to the sender.
-   **Shred**: Shred the delivery.

Each of these handling options can have associated charges, which you can set up using products in your Nexudus account. This allows you to monetize your virtual office services effectively.

### Customization Options

Virtual Office Plans also let customers define:

-   **Company aliases**: The number of alternative company names a customer can use in their deliveries.
-   **Additional recipients**: How many extra recipients a customer can add to their account for their deliveries.
-   **Forwarding addresses per recipient**: The number of forwarding addresses each recipient can have.

These customization options ensure that your virtual office plans can be tailored to meet the specific needs of your customers, providing a flexible and professional service.
