Prorated plans are a great way to offer fair and accurate billing to your members, especially when they sign up or cancel their contracts mid-cycle. With prorating, the first and last invoices of a contract are automatically adjusted based on the number of days between the sign-up/cancellation dates and the contract's billing day.

## How Prorating Works

Prorating discounts the initial and last invoices of a contract based on the number of days between:

*   The sign-up date and the billing day of the contract for the initial invoice.
*   The cancellation date and the billing day of the contract for the last invoice.

    It's important to note that **benefits are not prorated**.

### First Invoice Discount

You can control the maximum number of days between the start date and the next billing day for prorating to apply using the **Discount the first invoice for up to X days based on how many days are left in the first billing cycle** setting.

For example, if you set this option to 15 days, and a member signs up for a plan 10 days before their first billing cycle, they'll get a discount on their first invoice. However, if they sign up 20 days before their first billing cycle, the invoice won't be prorated.

Let's say you have a plan that costs 300 per month, and the billing cycle starts on the 1st of each month. If a member signs up on the 16th of the month, their first invoice will be prorated to reflect the 15 days remaining in the month. In this case, the first invoice would be around $150 (300/30), a 50% discount, as only half of the month is being billed.

### Last Invoice Discount

The **Discount the last invoice based on the day members leave contracts for this plan** option adjusts the last invoice based on the number of days between the billing day and the day the member cancels their plan. 

For example, if a member's billing cycle starts on the 1st of each month, and they cancel their plan on the 15th of the month, their last invoice will be prorated to reflect the 15 days they won't be using the plan.

### Accurate Day Calculation

Prorating accounts for the actual number of days in each month. This ensures accurate billing, regardless of whether a month has 28, 30, or 31 days.
